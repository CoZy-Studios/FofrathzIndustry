Writing down time spent coding, because why not

17/01/25
- R coding time 6h , 30min (5h 30min if distractions are subtracted)


Progress:
- Made the window
- created a grid
- tiles
- tile types exist now
- color (randomized to be less monotonous) for the tiles

19/01/25
- R began at 13:00, took a break 14:30

- cleaned up some code
- added procedural map generation
- fixed some minor (skill) issues
- prevented colors from getting re-randomized when the window leaves the screen
- added copper color
- tried rendering building Sprites

20/01/25
- R 10:30 - 11:40

- fixed redundancies
- implemented sprite loading
- created Building grid (filled with empty buildings)

21/01/25
- R 10:00 - 11:00

- fixed Grid rendering, the "hasBeenGenerated" randomly breaks
- code clean up
- no longer rendering empty buildings
- properly display the building type in the bottom left corner of the tile, instead of the top of the tile

22/1/25
- R 15:00-16:10 , 16:40 - 17:10

- Building Direction
- Sprite Rotation
- optimized the image loader to prevent ugly code
- beginning of a uniform naming system for Sprites
- experimented with adding a sidebar (/new window)

///DevLog Text between these two segments went missing thanks to merge errors (i love github)

12/03/25
- Acknowledgement of forgetting about the devlog
- Added a custom logger to make debugging easier
- finally got the breakthrough in the building placing branch

18/03/25
- getOutput
- UpdateInput(WIP), still need cases for removal, and whatever else might turn up
- Moved SuroundingBuilding to game panel
- OnChange updater
- directionToBuilding
- Item actually has code now, not just a type
- building works by now (unsure when it worked for the first time, but here for sure)


23/03/25
- finished Updating input
- update all inputs in a chain of buildings, instead of just the ones directly around the change (one error is still around because it wont be updated around corners)
- all sprites for buildings have been added, and loaded (bless my old sprite loading method, it still works perfectly without any change (aside from turning it on))
- implemented sprite rotation
- multiple buttons for all buildings (created dynamically)

24/03/25
- fixed bugs (building multiple buildings on one tile, holding multiple buildings at once)
- delete buildings
- wrote some things into rezi
- added a lot more text to devlog, despire not having a proper clue what happened when lol
