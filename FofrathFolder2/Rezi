Reflection

problems:
- School PCs are trash, they can neither handle the game smoothly, nor is their java version up to date, leading to frequent errors (".getFirst()" doesnt exist for school computers)
- Random small logic errors that take hours to fix (normal coding experience)
- UI related code is very janky (ask SzyZuu for more information)
- keyhandlers randomly not working 
- random map generation has a chance to create a map that is impossible to play (no ores)
- random merge errors (half of the devlog dissapeared, as well as a lot of code)
- devlog shouldve been kept better

what went well
- logic code having the tendency to work on the first try (like OnChange) thanks to planning ahead
- good structure for file / sprite handling -> could be improved by using folders, especially in the src/main/java/com/cozystudios/fofrathzindustry
- creation of a custom Logger instead of system.out.printLn(), for improved debugging potential (filterable by class, easily disableable to prevent the clogging of the console, without losing any capability that print has) 
- random map generation
- good limiting of the scope for the game, no crunch was necessary to get our product to the state it is in right now
- few comments in code, only to make certain things easier to see without bloating the code
- overall little bloat
- good centralisation of code, keeping most logic outside of the frequently instantiated objects
